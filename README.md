# Lottery Codex

Web application that scrapes Wisconsin Lottery drawing history, analyzes odd/even and low/high distribution patterns (Lottery Codex methodology), and generates optimized number panels for Badger Five and Super Cash games.

## Development Process

This project is developed using a structured, milestone-driven workflow inspired by professional software engineering practices rather than ad-hoc feature development.

Development includes:
- Phase-based roadmap planning
- Kanban project tracking
- Milestone-driven delivery
- Issue-based implementation
- Branch-per-task workflows
- Pull request reviews and QA validation
- AI-assisted development workflows and automation

Project planning, Kanban boards, milestones, and issue tracking are managed on a self-hosted Gitea instance, while this GitHub repository serves as a public mirror of the source code and commit history.

## Supported Games

| Game | Numbers | Range | Draw Days | Status |
|------|---------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Badger 5** (`badger-five`) | 5 | 1-31 | Daily | Fully functional |
| **SuperCash!** (`supercash`) | 6 | 1-39 | Daily | Fully functional |

## Architecture

```
Frontend (React SPA) <--JSON--> Backend (Slim API) <--CURL--> wilottery.com (scraping)
     :5959                    Docker container                live HTTP request
```

- **Frontend** -- React 18 + Vite 5 + Tailwind CSS v4 + React Router DOM. Served as a PWA with manifest and service worker skeleton. Currently in scaffolding phase: only the `App` placeholder component exists (counter demo). API integration layer exists at `frontend/src/services/api.js` providing fetch wrappers for all four backend endpoints. No routes or pages defined yet.
- **Backend** -- PHP 8.2-FPM powered by Slim Framework 4 (PSR-4 autoloading via Composer), REST JSON endpoints in `backend/api.php` (thin routing table delegating to `GamesController`). Controller uses a `$registry` pattern mapping game IDs to class names. Game logic classes implement `GameInterface`. HTML scraping via vendored simplehtmldom library. History endpoint currently returns static mock data; generate endpoint calls real `GameInterface::generateTickets()`.
- **Infrastructure** -- Single Docker container running Nginx + PHP-FPM on port 80. No database, no caching layer. Host port 5959 maps to container port 80.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose

### With Docker (primary workflow)

```bash
docker compose up --build    # Start at http://localhost:5959
docker compose down          # Stop containers
```

### Local Development (iterative frontend)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install                  # Install dependencies
npm run dev                  # Vite dev server on port 5173, proxies /api to backend
npm run build                # Production build to dist/
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` requests to `http://192.168.0.91:5959`. Update `frontend/vite.config.js` if the backend host changes. Backend changes are reflected immediately via Docker volume mount; frontend changes require `docker compose up --build` since `frontend/dist/` is baked into the image.

## Pattern System (Lottery Codex Methodology)

The core algorithm classifies numbers into four pools and generates panels matching target odd/even and low/high distributions:

| Pool | Badger Five (1-31) | Super Cash (1-39) |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|
| **Low-Odd** | 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 | 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19 |
| **Low-Even** | 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 | 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 |
| **High-Odd** | 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31 | 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39 |
| **High-Even** | 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 | 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38 |

Each sub-pattern specifies which pool each ball position draws from. The final panel is sorted ascending (required for lottery tickets). Uniqueness enforcement uses a linear scan across all previously generated panels -- O(n^2) in total panels.
